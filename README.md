Developed a comprehensive Book Information System using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to manage and organize book data efficiently. This web application enables users to perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on book information, providing an intuitive interface for librarians and users to manage their collections.

Key Features:

Create: Add new books to the system with details like title, author, genre, and publication date.
Read: Browse and search the book collection using various filters, ensuring quick access to desired information.
Update: Modify existing book records, allowing for easy maintenance of the database.
Delete: Remove outdated or irrelevant books from the system, keeping the collection up-to-date.
The system leverages MongoDB for data storage, Express.js for server-side logic, React.js for building a dynamic front-end user interface, and Node.js for back-end operations. The project demonstrates my ability to build full-stack applications and my proficiency in managing data-driven systems.
